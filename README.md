# WindowsCalculator
This application is a calulator which has some basic functionalities and have the same look and feel of the Windows Calculator.
Some main functionalities include entering values through keyboard and continous chain of calculations just by pressing the arithmetic operators instead of the = button everytime.

There are detailed comments in the solutions explaining the code behind the application

The most interesting aspect of the solution is the second screen in the calculator where you can see your equation and also the backButton allowing the chars on the screen to go off-screen. The way the program handles the dangling chars and the chars on the other screen is very complex and there might still be some bugs in the code that needs to be worked out.
